# NLP-LLM-Analysis-on-Consumer-Complaints
This repository contains my work on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for analyzing Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) complaints. The project involves text preprocessing, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and leveraging GPT-3.5 for summarization and feedback generation.
